#Unicorn API

Trying to learn how to create a CRUD API with Express and Node.  Currently unable to get it to do all four CRUD functionalities.
Things Learned:
* Place console logs to debug where the connection is being dropped throughout the server
* With each API requests its a chaining command
* Try to follow better Javascript syntax

Things To Do:
* Add a new schema where each Unicorn has one or many ponies
* Use the foreman library and the Modulus plugin to connect a third party database
